## kivakit-build &nbsp; ![](../documentation/images/kivakit-64.png)

This project is used in building [KivaKit](https://github.com/Telenav/kivakit). It can also be used for the same purpose  
in building user applications.

It saves and loads build metadata to *build.properties*:

    build-date = 2021.04.01  
    build-number = 117  
    build-name = sparkling bongos

The *build number* is the number of days since the start of the KivaKit epoch on  
December 5, 2020. The build number is used to create a memorable *build-name*,  
in this case "sparkling bongos".
