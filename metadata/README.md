# TDK Build - Metadata &nbsp; ![](../documentation/images/tag-40.png)

The *tdk-build-metadata* project creates build metadata consumed by the TDK and   
other projects. The *Metadata* class is run at build-time to create the build metadata  
files *build.properties* and *project.properties*. The same class is also used at runtime  
to access these data as property maps.
